            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Robert Major" class="profile-img">
            <p>Hello! I'm Robert Major, a visionary technologist with extensive experience in <strong>automation</strong>, <strong>scripting</strong>, <strong>UNIX</strong>, and <strong>cloud technologies</strong>. My passion for continuous learning and innovation has driven me to refine my skills across various technical environments over the years. I thrive in collaborative team settings, where I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others.</p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in the latest tech trends, I'm living a vibrant life as a husband and father. Our home is filled with energy, thanks to our lovable cat and dog. Cooking is one of my great passions—whether I'm whipping up a quick weekday meal or experimenting with a new recipe, the kitchen is my sanctuary. I'm literally lost in the sauce.</p>
            <p>Music plays a significant role in my life. As a musician and recording engineer, I play the drums, guitar, bass, synthesizers, and even lend my voice to my tracks. Creating and producing music is my creative outlet, allowing me to blend electronic and organic sounds into unique auditory experiences.</p>
            <p>I've been a lifelong technology enthusiast, starting with the Commodore 64, writing BASIC, and moving on to 68k Apple computers, PowerPCs, and Windows PCs running DOS/Win3.11. My journey included exploring Dialup BBS services and the rapid expansion of Linux technology. This passion led me to a Third Shift Global Support desk job at Fairchild Semiconductor in South Portland, Maine, where I was exposed to a vast array of technologies. I developed a particular interest in UNIX systems and noticed I rarely had to wake up the UNIX admins. After several years of working long nights, supporting the global manufacturing infrastructure, and triaging everything from database issues to troubleshooting legacy UNIX systems, I had studied enough to secure a UNIX administrator job at TD Bank.</p>
            <p>Over the last 20 years, I've gained extensive experience in both IT and the financial industry. My journey in IT began at TD Bank as a Solaris and MQSeries Administrator. From there, I transitioned to Wachovia Bank, where I served as a Systems Engineer, focusing on Linux and UNIX automation and providing WebSphere ND support for the Brokerage unit. After Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo, I continued to offer WebSphere support for the Brokerage and gradually advanced into a Senior Engineering role within the Middleware organization. In this role, I specialized as an Automation, Tools, and Integration Engineer, delivering effective, reliable, and maintainable automation solutions and tools across the corporation.</p>
            <p>My most recent position at Wells Fargo involved supporting their Cloud presence on Azure within the AI/ML department. Leveraging my extensive automation experience, I provided solutions and tools to facilitate the company's expansion into the Cloud. I am currently seeking new and exciting opportunities that match my skills, where I can continue to learn and provide significant value to a team, a company, and a vision.</p>
            <p>Some of my recent projects include experimenting with GPT to create websites like this one and exploring home automation technologies to make life smarter and more efficient. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities that leverage my expertise in automation, UNIX, and cloud technologies, ideally in a remote work environment. If my experience sounds like it might be a good fit for your project, please check out my complete resume and get in touch!</p>
